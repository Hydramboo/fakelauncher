*I swear, it is really just a feature phone, not a smart phone!*

**Disguise your feature-phone-like smart phone (feature phone style but uses Android system) as a real feature phone.**

## Function
Disguise your feature-phone-like smart phone (feature phone style but uses Android system) as a real feature phone.

For example, here's a feature-phone-like smart phone appears in China: 
<div align="center">

![TCL T508N](readme-assets/E1.jpg)

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | TCL onetouch E1 5G |
| Code | T508N |
| SoC | Unisoc T157 (ums9620) |
| Android ver. | 13 Tiramisu |

</div>

As you can see, this phone **looks like a feature phone** but actually has an high version of Android and 64 bit SoC with 5G support. That means you can use it as an common Android phone, **with games and media softwares installed.**

This feature attracted a number of senior high students in China to choose it and bring it to school so that they can use it as smartphone much safer than real smartphone. Including me.

But what if teachers notice its **UI**? It is just a common smartphone UI. So if your teachers find out your feature phone is actually a smartphone, **you're done.**

As a result, `fakelauncher` is developed by me to solve this problem
